# Contributing to Neurostim
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

* Reporting a bug
* Submitting a fix
* Proposing new features

## We Develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as to review and accept pull requests.

## We Use Github Flow, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

* Fork the repo and create your branch from master.
* Add your code, add tests of your code.
* Document your code.
* Add a demo to illustrate the use of your code.
* Issue that pull request!

When you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same license that covers the project.

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Great Bug Reports tend to have:

* A quick summary and/or background
* Specific steps to reproduce
* Give sample code if you can.
* What you expected would happen
* What actually happens
* Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
