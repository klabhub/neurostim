% Tilt AfterEffect Example
% 
% Data recorded with this experiment are analyzed with some simple analysis
% code at the end of this script.
% 
%  The experiment starts once the subject fixates the red dot (use the
%  mouse), and the task is to determine whether the second grating
%  presented in a trial is clockwise (press 'l') or counterclockwise (press
%  'a') from vertical.
% 
% The first trial has a long adapter, successive trials have short top-up
% adapter. The first block has CCW adaptation, the second block CW.
