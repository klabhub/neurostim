% The subjects task is to detect the location of a Gabor:  left (press
% 'a') or right (press 'l')

% The demo uses psyBayes to estimate the threshold
% for correct detection, separately for +45 and -45 degree oriented gratings.
%
% If you run this a second time you get the option to include the pervious run's 
% estimates. 
% 
% The demo can use  key presses, or simulate an observer with a
% fixed threshold by setting pianola to true.
