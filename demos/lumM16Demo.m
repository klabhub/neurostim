%% Calibrated Luminance Demo
%
% This demo shows how to use calibrated luminance to specify your stimuli
% using the M16 mode on a ViewPixx device. This screen type can generate
% high bit-depth monochromatic stimuli (M16 = ~ monochromatic 16 bits), while 
% at the same time having 256 colors available to show simpler items (like a
% red fixation dot), using indexed colors. 
% 
% Have a look at lumDemo first to see how luminance calibration works for
% a generic monitor.
