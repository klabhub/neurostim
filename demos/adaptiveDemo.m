function adaptiveDemo
% Demo to show adaptive threshold estimation.
%
% The subjects task is to detect the location of a Gabor:  left (press
% 'a') or right (press 'l')
%
% The demo can use QUEST or a Staircase procedure to estimate the threshold
% for correct detection, separately for +45 and -45 degree oriented gratings.
%
% The demo can use  key presses, or simulate an observer with a
% fixed threshold by setting pianola to true.

% Define a simulated observer with different thresholds for the two
% conditions. This should be visible when you run this demo with pianola=true; one orientation
% should converge on a low contrast, the other on a high contrast.

% 1 for 'a', 2 for 'l')

%% Setup the conditions in a design object
d=design('orientation');
d.fac1.grating.orientation = [-45 45];  % One factor (orientation)
nrLevels = d.nrLevels;

% We also want to change some parameters
% in an "adaptive" way. You do this by assigning values
% to the .conditions field of the design object .
if strcmpi(method,'QUEST')
    % To estimate threshold adaptively, the Quest method can be used. We need
    % to define two functions to map the random intensity variable with values between
    % -Inf and Inf that Quest "optimizes" to a meaningful contrast value. We'll
    % assume that the Quest intensity models the log10 of the contrast. i2p and
    % p2i implement that mapping.
    i2p = @(x) (min(10.^x,1)); % Map Quest intensity to contrast values in [0 , 1]
    p2i = @(x) (log10(x));
    % Define a quest procedure with an initial guess, and our confidence in
    % that guess, and tell the Quest procedure which function to evaluate to
    % determine whether the response was correct or not. To setup Quest to use
    % the subject's responses, use the following:
    
    % Note again the .conditions usage that applies the Quest plugin to each level of the first factor.
    % An important difference with the Jitter parameter above is that we
    % want to have a separate quest for the two orientations. To achieve
    % that we could explicitly create two Quest plugins and assign those to the
    % conditions(:,1).grat ing.contrast = { quest1,quest2}, but in the current example both Quests have
    % identical parameters, so it is easier to duplicate them using the duplicate function.
    %
    % Please note that you should not use repmat for this purpose as it will repmat the
    % handles to the Quest object, not the object itself. In other words, if you used repmat you'd still use the
    % same Quest object for both orientations and could not estimate a
    % separate threshold per orientation.    
    d.conditions(:,1).grating.contrast = duplicate(plugins.quest(c, '@choice.correct','guess',p2i(0.25),'guessSD',4,'i2p',i2p,'p2i',p2i),[nrLevels 1]);   
elseif strcmpi(method,'STAIRCASE')
    % As an alternative adaptive threshold estimation procedure, consider the 1-up 1-down staircase with fixed 0.01 stepsize on contrast.
    % With user responses, you use:
    d.conditions(:,1).grating.contrast = duplicate(plugins.nDown1UpStaircase(c,'@choice.correct',rand,'min',0,'max',1,'weights',[1 1],'delta',0.1),[nrLevels 1]);
end

% If you;d want to assign a different jitter object per condition (i.e. the
% different jitters are part of the design) you'd use something like this
% (the first level of the first factor (-45) jitters between 10 and -10,
% while the +45 orientation jitters between -15 and +15). If you use this,
% there is no need to assign the jitter to the g.X above , so comment that
% out.

% d.conditions(2,1).grating.X =  plugins.jitter(c,{15,-15},'distribution','1ofN');
