function adaptiveDemo
% Demo to show adaptive threshold estimation.
%
% The subjects task is to detect the location of a Gabor:  left (press
% 'a') or right (press 'l')
%
% The demo can use QUEST or a Staircase procedure to estimate the threshold
% for correct detection, separately for +45 and -45 degree oriented gratings.
%
% The demo can use  key presses, or simulate an observer with a
% fixed threshold by setting pianola to true.

% conditions. This should be visible when you run this demo with pianola=true; one orientation
% should converge on a low contrast, the other on a high contrast.

% 1 for 'a', 2 for 'l')

    k.simWhat =  simulatedObserver;   % This function will provide a simulated answer
    k.simWhen = '@grating.on + grating.duration+50';  % At this time.
end

c.trialDuration = '@choice.stopTime';       %End the trial as soon as the 2AFC response is made.


% There is a potentially tricky interaction between behavioral control (e.g. fixation)
% and adaptive parameters. In the current example, on any trial that ends without
% an answer (keypress), the choice object stores no response value,  then
% choice.success evaluates to [] and that is the signal for the adaptive
% parameter to ignore this trial for any updates. The components needed for
% this are 1) a trial outcome function used for the adaptive parameter 
% (here @choice.success) that evaluates to [] on
% trials without a key press (the keyResponse object does this for you). 2)
% a behavioral requirement that ends the trial prematurely. Here that is
% achieved with fix.failEndsTrial = true;
% 
% However, you may not want to end a trial on a fixation break, or you also
% want to discard adaptive parameter updates when a key has been pressed,
% but some behavioral requirement (e.g. fixation) is not met *after* the key
% press. For this, you specify the 'requiredBehaviors' of the adaptive
% object. At the end of the trial (and before updating the adpative
% parameter), the adaptive object will check whether these behaviors have
% completed successfully and only then update the parameter.  By default no
% behaviors are required. 

%% Enforce fixation

    e.useMouse = true;
end

%% Setup the conditions in a design object

% We also want to change some parameters
% in an "adaptive" way. You do this by assigning values
% to the .conditions field of the design object .
if strcmpi(method,'QUEST')
    % To estimate threshold adaptively, the Quest method can be used. We need
    % to define two functions to map the random intensity variable with values between
    % -Inf and Inf that Quest "optimizes" to a meaningful contrast value. We'll
    % assume that the Quest intensity models the log10 of the contrast. i2p and
    % p2i implement that mapping.
    i2p = @(x) (min(10.^x,1)); % Map Quest intensity to contrast values in [0 , 1]
    p2i = @(x) (log10(x));
    % Define a quest procedure with an initial guess, and our confidence in
    % that guess, and tell the Quest procedure which function to evaluate to
    % determine whether the response was correct or not. To setup Quest to use
    % the subject's responses, use the following:
    
    % Note again the .conditions usage that applies the Quest plugin to each level of the first factor.
    % An important difference with the Jitter parameter above is that we
    % want to have a separate quest for the two orientations. To achieve
    % that we could explicitly create two Quest plugins and assign those to the
    % conditions(:,1).grat ing.contrast = { quest1,quest2}, but in the current example both Quests have
    % identical parameters, so it is easier to duplicate them using the duplicate function.
    %
    % Please note that you should not use repmat for this purpose as it will repmat the
    % handles to the Quest object, not the object itself. In other words, if you used repmat you'd still use the
    % same Quest object for both orientations and could not estimate a
    % separate threshold per orientation.

% If you;d want to assign a different jitter object per condition (i.e. the
% different jitters are part of the design) you'd use something like this
% (the first level of the first factor (-45) jitters between 10 and -10,

% there is no need to assign the jitter to the g.X above , so comment that
