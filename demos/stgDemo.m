%% Stimulation defined per trial
% In this mode, stimulation can be turned on at a specific time in a trial (stg.on)
% and it will last for a specified, fixed duration  (stg.duration).
% Stimulation starts fresh with each trial, regardless of the duration parameter (in
% other words the duration should be less than the trial duration so that it can finish).
% A stimulus that has not finished when the new trial starts is set to zero (not ramped down). 
% Note that the rampUp and rampDown are included in the duration.

% Specify shared parameters-  in principle these apply to each of the channels (because
% they are specified as scalars), but by specifing the .channel we limit
% stimulation to that channel alone. Setting .channel = [1 2] would apply
% the same stimulation to both channels.

% Define a noise function with output that depends on the amplitude/mean
% set per trial

% If you want stimulation to continue throughout a block, regardless of its
% duration, you can set the .duration to a large number (there are memory
% constraints... so not inf) and .persistent to true. When the new block
% starts  (or any trial with different stimulation parameters), the current
% stimulation will be terminated and the new one will be started. That new
% one could be 0 mA , or sham as defined here. You can test this by setting
% the nrRepeats to 5 in the above example.  There will be a warning on the
% command line that stimulation was terminated early, but other than that
% the design works; a tACS block followed by a Sham block. The main
% disadvantage is that there is no ramp-down in this case.
