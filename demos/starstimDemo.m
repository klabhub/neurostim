        % Load a protocol, start the ramp up phase in the first trial for which .enabeled=true
        % and start that trial as soon as ramp-up is complete. Neurostim sends trialStart markers
        % to NIC (and these can be seen in the NIC interface) but does not interact
        % with it in any other way. Once the last trial in the block is done
        % (or at the end of the experiment) the current is ramped down.
        % The protocol is ramped up again if a subsequent block has .enabled =true.
        %
        % This mode is useful for stimulation paradigms on a time scale
        % of whole experiments or blocks. For instance in the example below, the
        % first block uses a different protocol than the second block.
        %
        % This mode also allows for a Sham option. When .sham=true, the protocol is
        % ramped up and immeditately ramped down again. It stays in sham for the

    case 'TRIAL'
        % %% Example TRIAL mode
        % In this mode the protocol will ramp up before
        % each trial in which .enabled=true (adding ITI) and ramp down
        % after each such trial (adding more ITI there).  Note that stim.on times are
        % ignored in this mode (and in the BLOCKED mode).
        % Because the protocol is simply ramped up/down repeatedly, this mode makes
        % most sense to deliver one kind of stimulation (let's say 10 Hz Ac) to one
        % set of electrodes. In that case you'd define a single protocol in NIC
        % which has the appropriate montage, set the stim parameters (1mA,
        % 10Hz,etc.) and set the duration of the protocol to something that is much
        % longer than your experiment.
        % The temporal resolution of this stim paradigm is limited by the allowable
        % ramp settings in the NIC. Currently a ramp (.transition) takes at least 100 ms
        % This time is spent in the ITI. This would result a longer ITI
        % before a stimulated trial than before a non-stimulated trial. So if the design involves
        % such trials (.enabled = false and .enabled =true) then it may be wise to
        % set the c.iti to 1s such that all ITIs are equally long.
        % A similar issue arises with sham controls; the ramp up/down takes place
        % in the ITI and will make that ITI longer than an ITI without sham. Again,
        % setting the ITI to a longer time should solve this.
